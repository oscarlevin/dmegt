<li><p>This is the set of all numbers which are 3 less than a natural number (i.e., that if you add 3 to them, you get a natural number). The set could also be written as \(\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}\) (note that 0 is a natural number, so \(-3\) is in this set because \(-3 + 3 = 0\)).</p></li>
<li><p>This is the set of all natural numbers which are 3 less than a natural number. So here we just have \(\{0, 1, 2,3 \ldots\}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>This is the set of all integers  (positive and negative whole numbers, written \(\Z\)). In other words, \(\{\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Here we want all numbers \(x\) such that \(x\) and \(-x\) are natural numbers. There is only one: 0. So we have the set \(\{0\}\text{.}\)</p></li>
