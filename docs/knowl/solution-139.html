<p>This is an example of the pigeonhole principle. We can prove it by contrapositive.</p>

<p>Suppose that each number only came up 6 or fewer times. So there are at most six 1's, six 2's, and so on. That's a total of 36 dice, so you must not have rolled all 40 dice.</p></article>

<p>We can have 9 dice without any four matching or any four being all different: three 1's, three 2's, three 3's. We will prove that whenever you roll 10 dice, you will always get four matching or all being different.</p>
<article class="proof"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h6>
<p>Suppose you roll 10 dice, but that there are NOT four matching rolls. This means at most, there are three of any given value. If we only had three different values, that would be only 9 dice, so there must be 4 different values, giving 4 dice that are all different.</p></article>
