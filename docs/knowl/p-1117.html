<p> These molecular statements are of course still statements, so they must be either true or false. The absolutely key observation here is that which <dfn class="terminology">truth value</dfn> the molecular statement achieves is completely determined by the type of connective and the truth values of the parts. We do not need to know what the parts actually say, only whether those parts are true or false. So to analyze logical connectives, it is enough to consider <dfn class="terminology">propositional variables</dfn> (sometimes called <em class="emphasis">sentential</em> variables), usually capital letters in the middle of the alphabet: \(P, Q, R, S, \ldots\text{.}\) We think of these as standing in for (usually atomic) statements, but there are only two <em class="emphasis">values</em> the variables can achieve: true or false.<a class="fn-knowl" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-6-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> We also have symbols for the logical connectives: \(\wedge\text{,}\) \(\vee\text{,}\) \(\imp\text{,}\) \(\iff\text{,}\) \(\neg\text{.}\)</p>
