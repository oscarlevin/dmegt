<p>Pictures like the dot and line drawing are called <dfn class="terminology">graphs</dfn>. Graphs are made up of a collection of dots called <dfn class="terminology">vertices</dfn>  and lines connecting those dots called <dfn class="terminology">edges</dfn>.  When two vertices are connected by an edge, we say they are <dfn class="terminology">adjacent</dfn>.  The nice thing about looking at graphs instead of pictures of rivers, islands and bridges is that we now have a mathematical object to study. We have distilled the “important” parts of the bridge picture for the purposes of the problem. It does not matter how big the islands are, what the bridges are made out of, if the river contains alligators, etc. All that matters is which land masses are connected to which other land masses, and how many times. </p>
