<p>A standard deck of 52 cards consists of 4 suites (hearts, diamonds, spades and clubs) each containing 13 different values (Ace, 2, 3, …, 10, J, Q, K). If you draw some number of cards at random you might or might not have a pair (two cards with the same value) or three cards all of the same suit. However, if you draw enough cards, you will be guaranteed to have these. For each of the following, find the smallest number of cards you would need to draw to be guaranteed having the specified cards. Prove your answers.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Three of a kind (for example, three 7's).</p></li>
<li><p>A flush of five cards (for example, five hearts).</p></li>
<li><p>Three cards that are either all the same suit or all different suits.</p></li>
