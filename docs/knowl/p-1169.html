<li><p>We have \(P \imp Q\) and \(P\text{,}\) so \(Q\) follows. Sue gets an A.</p></li>
<li><p>You cannot conclude anything. Sue could have gotten the A because she did extra credit for example. Notice that we do not know that if Sue gets an \(A\text{,}\) then she gets a 93% on her final. That is the converse of the original implication, so it might or might not be true.</p></li>
<li><p>The contrapositive of the converse of \(P \imp Q\) is \(\neg P \imp \neg Q\text{,}\) which states that if Sue does not get a 93% on the final, then she will not get an A in the class. But this does not follow from the original implication. Again, we can conclude nothing. Sue could have done extra credit.</p></li>
<li><p>What would happen if Sue does not get an A but <em class="emphasis">did</em> get a 93% on the final? Then \(P\) would be true and \(Q\) would be false. This makes the implication \(P \imp Q\) false! It must be that Sue did not get a 93% on the final. Notice now we have the implication \(\neg Q \imp \neg P\) which is the contrapositive of \(P \imp Q\text{.}\) Since \(P \imp Q\) is assumed to be true, we know \(\neg Q \imp \neg P\) is true as well.</p></li>
