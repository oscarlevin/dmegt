<p> It is important that the events be <dfn class="terminology">disjoint</dfn>: i.e., that there is no way for \(A\) and \(B\) to both happen at the same time. For example, a standard deck of 52 cards contains \(26\) red cards and \(12\) face cards. However, the number of ways to select a card which is either red or a face card is not \(26 + 12 = 38\text{.}\) This is because there are 6 cards which are both red and face cards.</p>
