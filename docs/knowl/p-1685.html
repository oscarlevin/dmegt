<p>Consider the statement, “For all natural numbers \(n\text{,}\) if \(n\) is prime, then \(n\) is solitary.” You do not need to know what <em class="emphasis">solitary</em> means for this problem, just that it is a property that some numbers have and others do not.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Write the converse and the contrapositive of the statement, saying which is which. Note: the original statement claims that an implication is true for all \(n\text{,}\) and it is that implication that we are taking the converse and contrapositive of.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the negation of the original statement. What would you need to show to prove that the statement is false?</p></li>
<li><p>Even though you don't know whether 10 is solitary (in fact, nobody knows this), is the statement “if 10 is prime, then 10 is solitary” true or false? Explain.</p></li>
<li><p>It turns out that 8 is solitary. Does this tell you anything about the truth or falsity of the original statement, its converse or its contrapositive? Explain.</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming that the original statement is true, what can you say about the relationship between the <em class="emphasis">set</em> \(P\) of prime numbers and the <em class="emphasis">set</em> \(S\) of solitary numbers. Explain.</p></li>
