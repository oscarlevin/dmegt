<li><p>She has \({15 \choose 6}\) ways to select the 6 bridesmaids, and then for each way, has 6 choices for the maid of honor. Thus she has \({15 \choose 6}6\) choices.</p></li>
<li><p>She has 15 choices for who will be her maid of honor. Then she needs to select 5 of the remaining 14 friends to be bridesmaids, which she can do in \({14 \choose 5}\) ways. Thus she has \(15 {14 \choose 5}\) choices.</p></li>
<li><p>We have answered the question (how many wedding parties can the bride choose from) in two ways. The first way gives the left-hand side of the identity and the second way gives the right-hand side of the identity. Therefore the identity holds.</p></li>
