<p>Ten members of Math Club are driving to a math conference in a neighboring state. However, some of these students have dated in the past, and things are still a little awkward. Each student lists which other students they refuse to share a car with; these conflicts are recored in the table below. What is the fewest number of cars the club needs to make the trip? Do not worry about running out of seats, just avoid the conflicts.</p>
