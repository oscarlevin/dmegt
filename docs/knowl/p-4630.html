<p>Now you might very naturally ask why we would do such a thing. One reason is that encoding a sequence with a power series helps us keep track of which term is which in the sequence. For example, if we write the sequence \(1, 3, 4, 6, 9, \ldots, 24, 41,\ldots\) it is impossible to determine which term \(24\) is (even if we agreed that the first term was supposed to be \(a_0\)). However, if we wrote the generating series instead, we would have \(1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 6x^3 + 9x^4 + \cdots + 24 x^{17} + 41 x^{18} + \cdots\text{.}\) Now it is clear that 24 is the 17th term of the sequence (that is, \(a_{17} = 24\)). Of course to get this benefit we could have displayed our sequence in any number of ways, perhaps \(\fbox{1}_0 \fbox{3}_1 \fbox{4}_2 \fbox{6}_3 \fbox{9}_4 \cdots \fbox{24}_{17}\fbox{41}_{18}\cdots\text{,}\) but we do not do this. The reason is that the generating series looks like an ordinary power series (although we are interpreting it differently) so we can do things with it that we ordinarily do with power series such as write down what it converges to.</p>
