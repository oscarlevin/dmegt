<li><p>This must be the degree sequence for a tree. This is because the vertex of degree 4 must be adjacent to the four vertices of degree 1 (there are no other vertices for it to be adjacent to), and thus we get a star.</p></li>
<li>
<p>This cannot be a tree. Each degree 3 vertex is adjacent to all but one of the vertices in the graph. Thus each must be adjacent to one of the degree 1 vertices (and not the other). That means both degree 3 vertices are adjacent to the degree 2 vertex, and to each other, so that means there is a cycle.</p>
<p>Alternatively, count how many edges there are!</p>
</li>
<li><p>This might or might not be a tree. The length 4 path has this degree sequence (this is a tree), but so does the union of a 3-cycle and a length 1 path (which is not connected, so not a tree).</p></li>
<li><p>This cannot be a tree. The sum of the degrees is 28, so there are 14 edges. But there are 14 vertices as well, so we don't have \(v = e+1\text{,}\) meaning this cannot be a tree.</p></li>
