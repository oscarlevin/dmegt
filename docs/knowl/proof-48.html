<p>Let \(P(n)\) be the statement “\(n\) is either a power of 2 or can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2.” We will show that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 1\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Base case: \(1 = 2^0\) is a power of 2, so \(P(1)\) is true.</p>
<p>Inductive case: Suppose \(P(k)\) is true for all \(k \lt n\text{.}\) Now if \(n\) is a power of 2, we are done. If not, let \(2^x\) be the largest power of 2 strictly less than \(n\text{.}\) Consider \(n - 2^x\text{,}\) which is a smaller number, in fact smaller than both \(n\) and \(2^x\text{.}\) Thus \(n-2^x\) is either a power of 2 or can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2, but none of them are going to be \(2^x\text{,}\) so the together with \(2^x\) we have written \(n\) as the sum of distinct powers of 2.</p>
<p>Therefore, by the principle of (strong) mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 1\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_seq-induction.html#jIJ">in-context</a></span>
