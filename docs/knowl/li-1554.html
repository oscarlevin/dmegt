<p>We must use the three games (call them 1, 2, 3) as the domain and the 5 friends (a,b,c,d,e) as the codomain (otherwise the function would not be defined for the whole domain when a friend didn't get any game). So how many functions are there with domain \(\{1,2,3\}\) and codomain \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\text{?}\) The answer to this is \(5^3=125\text{,}\) since we can assign any of 5 elements to be the image of 1, any of 5 elements to be the image of 2 and any of 5 elements to be the image of 3.</p>
<p>But this is not the correct answer to our counting problem, because one of these functions is \(f= \twoline{1\amp 2\amp 3}{a\amp a\amp a}\text{;}\) one friend can get more than one game. What we really need to do is count <em class="emphasis">injective</em> functions. This gives \(P(5,3) = 60\) functions, which is the answer to our counting question.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_advPIE.html#LZo">in-context</a></span>
