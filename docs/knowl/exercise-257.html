<p>After a late night of math studying, you and your friends decide to go to your favorite tax-free fast food Mexican restaurant, <em class="emphasis">Burrito Chime</em>. You decide to order off of the dollar menu, which has 7 items. Your group has $16 to spend (and will spend all of it).</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>How many different orders are possible? Explain. (The <em class="emphasis">order</em> in which the order is placed does not matter - just which and how many of each item that is ordered.)</p></li>
<li><p>How many different orders are possible if you want to get at least one of each item? Explain.</p></li>
<li><p>How many different orders are possible if you don't get more than 4 of any one item? Explain.</p></li>
