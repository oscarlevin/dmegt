<body><div class="solution solution-like"><p>\(G\) has 10 edges, since \(10 = \frac{2+2+3+4+4+5}{2}\text{.}\) It could be planar, and then it would have 6 faces, using Euler's formula: \(6-10+f = 2\) means \(f = 6\text{.}\) To make sure that it is actually planar though, we would need to draw a graph with those vertex degrees without edges crossing. This can be done by trial and error (and is possible).</p></div></body>
