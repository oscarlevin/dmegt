<p>Your neighborhood grocery store has a candy machine full of Skittles.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<p>Suppose that the candy machine currently holds exactly 650 Skittles, and every time someone inserts a quarter, exactly 7 Skittles come out of the machine.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>How many Skittles will be left in the machine after 20 quarters have been inserted?</p></li>
<li><p>Will there ever be exactly zero Skittles left in the machine? Explain.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>What if the candy machine gives 7 Skittles to the first customer who put in a quarter, 10 to the second, 13 to the third, 16 to the fourth, etc. How many Skittles has the machine given out after 20 quarters are put into the machine?</p></li>
<li><p>Now, what if the machine gives 4 Skittles to the first customer, 7 to the second, 12 to the third, 19 to the fourth, etc. How many Skittles has the machine given out after 20 quarters are put into the machine?</p></li>
