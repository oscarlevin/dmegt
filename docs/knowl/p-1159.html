<p>True. The original implication is a little hard to analyze because there are so many different combinations of nine cards. But consider the contrapositive: If you <em class="emphasis">don't</em> have at least three cards all of the same suit, then you don't have nine cards. It is easy to see why this is true: you can at most have two cards of each of the four suits, for a total of eight cards (or fewer).</p>
