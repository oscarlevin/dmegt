<p>Perhaps in investigating the problem above you picked some amounts of postage, and then figured out whether you could make that amount using just 8-cent and 5-cent stamps. Perhaps you did this in order: can you make 1 cent of postage? Can you make 2 cents? 3 cents? And so on. If this is what you did, you were actually answering a <em class="emphasis">sequence</em> of questions. We have methods for dealing with sequences. Let's see if that helps.</p>
