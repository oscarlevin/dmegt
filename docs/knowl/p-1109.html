<p>It is important to understand the conditions under which an implication is true not only to decide whether a mathematical statement is true, but in order to <em class="emphasis">prove</em> that it is. Proofs might seem scary (especially if you have had a bad high school geometry experience) but all we are really doing is explaining (very carefully) why a statement is true. If you understand the truth conditions for an implication, you already have the outline for a proof.</p>
