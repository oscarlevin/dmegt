<p>The rule says that \(f(6) = f(5) + 11\) (we are using \(6 = n+1\) so \(n = 5\)). We don't know what \(f(5)\) is though. Well, we know that \(f(5) = f(4) + 9\text{.}\) So we need to compute \(f(4)\text{,}\) which will require knowing \(f(3)\text{,}\) which will require \(f(2)\text{,}\)… will it ever end?</p>
<p>Yes! In fact, this process will always end because we have \(\N\) as our domain, so there is a least element. And we gave the value of \(f(0)\) explicitly, so we are good. In fact, we might decide to work up to \(f(6)\) instead of working down from \(f(6)\text{:}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
f(1) = \amp f(0) + 1 = \amp 0 + 1 = 1\\
f(2) = \amp f(1) + 3 = \amp 1 + 3 = 4\\
f(3) = \amp f(2) + 5 = \amp 4 + 5 = 9\\
f(4) = \amp f(3) + 7 = \amp 9 + 7 = 16\\
f(5) = \amp f(4) + 9 = \amp 16 + 9 = 25\\
f(6) = \amp f(5) + 11 = \amp 25 + 11 = 36
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>It looks that this recursively defined function is the same as the explicitly defined function \(f(n) = n^2\text{.}\) Is it? Later we will prove that it is.</p>
