<p>\(f\) is a function. So is \(g\text{.}\) There is no problem with an element of the codomain not being the image of any input, and there is no problem with \(a\) from the codomain being the image of both 2 and 3 from the domain. We could use our two-line notation to write these as</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f= \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \\ d \amp a \amp c \amp b \end{pmatrix} \qquad g = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \\ d \amp a \amp a \amp b \end{pmatrix}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>However, \(h\) is NOT a function. In fact, it fails for two reasons. First, the element 1 from the domain has not been mapped to any element from the codomain. Second, the element 2 from the domain has been mapped to more than one element from the codomain (\(a\) and \(c\)). Note that either one of these problems is enough to make a rule not a function. In general, neither of the following mappings are functions:</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:13.75%;margin-right:13.75%;">
<div class="sbspanel" style="width:24.8275862068966%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/not-function-a.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div>
<div class="sbspanel" style="width:37.2413793103448%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/not-function-b.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div>
</div></div>
<p>It might also be helpful to think about how you would write the two-line notation for \(h\text{.}\) We would have something like:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h=\twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4}{\amp a,c? \amp d \amp b}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">There is nothing under 1 (bad) and we needed to put more than one thing under 2 (very bad). With a rule that is actually a function, the two-line notation will always “work”.</p>
