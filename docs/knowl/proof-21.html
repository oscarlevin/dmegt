<p>We will give a proof by induction on the number of vertices in the tree.  That is, we will prove that every tree with \(v\) vertices has exactly \(v-1\) edges, and then use induction to show this is true for all \(v \ge 1\text{.}\)</p>
<p>For the base case, consider all trees with \(v = 1\) vertices.  There is only one such tree: the graph with a single isolated vertex.  This graph has \(e = 0\) edges, so we see that \(e = v-1\) as needed.</p>
<p>Now for the inductive case, fix \(k \ge 1\) and assume that all trees with \(v=k\) vertices have exactly \(e=k-1\) edges.  Now consider an arbitrary tree \(T\) with \(v = k+1\) vertices.  By <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prop-leaves-in-trees.html" title="Proposition 2.5.3">Proposition 2.5.3</a>, \(T\) has a vertex \(v_0\) of degree one.  Let \(T'\) be the tree resulting from removing \(v_0\) from \(T\) (together with its incident edge).  Since we removed a leaf, \(T'\) is still a tree (the unique paths between pairs of vertices in \(T'\) are the same as the unique paths between them in \(T\)).</p>
<p>Now \(T'\) has \(k\) vertices, so by the inductive hypothesis, has \(k-1\) edges.  What can we say about \(T\text{?}\)  Well, it has one more edge than \(T'\text{,}\) so it has \(k\) edges.  But this is exactly what we wanted: \(v=k+1\text{,}\) \(e=k\) so indeed \(e = v-1\text{.}\)  This completes the inductive case, and the proof.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_trees.html#Lqh">in-context</a></span>
