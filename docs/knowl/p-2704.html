<p>The counting question: how many lattice paths are there between \((0,0)\) and \((3,2)\text{?}\) We could try to draw all of these, or instead of drawing them, maybe just list which direction we travel on each of the 5 steps. One path might be RRUUR, or maybe UURRR, or perhaps RURRU (those correspond to the three paths drawn above). So how many such strings of R's and U's are there?</p>
