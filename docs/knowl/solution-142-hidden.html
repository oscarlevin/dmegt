<p>First, the idea of the argument. What happens when we increase \(n\) by 1? On the left-hand side, we increase the base of the square and go to the next square number. On the right-hand side, we increase the power of 2. This means we double the number. So the question is, how does doubling a number relate to increasing to the next square? Think about what the difference of two consecutive squares looks like. We have \((n+1)^2 - n^2\text{.}\) This factors:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
(n+1)^2 - n^2 = (n+1-n)(n+1+n) = 2n+1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>But doubling the right-hand side increases it by \(2^n\text{,}\) since \(2^{n+1} = 2^n + 2^n\text{.}\) When \(n\) is large enough, \(2^n &gt; 2n + 1\text{.}\)</p>
<p>What we are saying here is that each time \(n\) increases, the left-hand side grows by less than the right-hand side. So if the left-hand side starts smaller (as it does when \(n = 5\)), it will never catch up. Now the formal proof:</p>
<article class="proof"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h6>
<p>Let \(P(n)\) be the statement \(n^2 \lt 2^n\text{.}\) We will prove \(P(n)\) is true for all integers \(n \ge 5\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Base case: \(P(5)\) is the statement \(5^2 \lt 2^5\text{.}\) Since \(5^2 = 25\) and \(2^5 = 32\text{,}\) we see that \(P(5)\) is indeed true.</p>
<p>Inductive case: Let \(k \ge 5\) be an arbitrary integer. Assume, for induction, that \(P(k)\) is true. That is, assume \(k^2 \lt  2^k\text{.}\) We will prove that \(P(k+1)\) is true, i.e., \((k+1)^2 \lt  2^{k+1}\text{.}\) To prove such an inequality, start with the left-hand side and work towards the right-hand side:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
(k+1)^2 \amp = k^2 + 2k + 1 \amp\\
\amp \lt 2^k + 2k + 1 \amp \ldots\text{by the inductive hypothesis.}\\
\amp \lt 2^k + 2^k \amp \ldots\text{ since } 2k + 1 \lt  2^k \text{ for }k \ge 5.\\
\amp = 2^{k+1}. \amp
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Following the equalities and inequalities through, we get \((k+1)^2 \lt 2^{k+1}\text{,}\) in other words, \(P(k+1)\text{.}\) Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 5\text{.}\)</p></article>
