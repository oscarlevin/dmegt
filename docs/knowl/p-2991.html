<p>This is a reasonable guess, since we have 14 choices for the first guest, then 13 for the second, and so on. But the guess is wrong (in fact, that product is exactly \(2162160 = P(14,6)\)). It distinguishes between the different orders in which we could invite the guests. To correct for this, we could divide by the number of different arrangements of the 6 guests (so that all of these would count as just one outcome). There are precisely \(6!\) ways to arrange 6 guests, so the correct answer to the first question is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11\cdot 10 \cdot 9}{6!}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
