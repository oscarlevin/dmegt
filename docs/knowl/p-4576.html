<p>Suppose we want to solve a recurrence relation expressed as a combination of the two previous terms, such as \(a_n = a_{n-1} + 6a_{n-2}\text{.}\) In other words, we want to find a function of \(n\) which satisfies \(a_n - a_{n-1} - 6a_{n-2} = 0\text{.}\) Now iteration is too complicated, but think just for a second what would happen if we <em class="emphasis">did</em> iterate. In each step, we would, among other things, multiply a previous iteration by 6. So our closed formula would include \(6\) multiplied some number of times. Thus it is reasonable to guess the solution will contain parts that look geometric. Perhaps the solution will take the form \(r^n\) for some constant \(r\text{.}\)</p>
