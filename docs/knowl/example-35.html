<p>Suppose it is true that I sing if and only if I'm in the shower. We know this means both that if I sing, then I'm in the shower, and also the converse, that if I'm in the shower, then I sing. Let \(P\) be the statement, “I sing,” and \(Q\) be, “I'm in the shower.” So \(P \imp Q\) is the statement “if I sing, then I'm in the shower.” Which part of the if and only if statement is this?</p>
<p>What we are really asking for is the meaning of “I sing <em class="emphasis">if</em> I'm in the shower” and “I sing <em class="emphasis">only if</em> I'm in the shower.” When is the first one (the “if” part) <em class="emphasis">false</em>? When I am in the shower but not singing. That is the same condition on being false as the statement “if I'm in the shower, then I sing.” So the “if” part is \(Q \imp P\text{.}\) On the other hand, to say, “I sing only if I'm in the shower” is equivalent to saying “if I sing, then I'm in the shower,” so the “only if” part is \(P \imp Q\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_intro-statements.html#jqB">in-context</a></span>
