<p>Consider bit strings with length \(l\) and weight \(k\) (so strings of \(l\) 0's and 1's, including \(k\) 1's). We know how to count the number of these for a fixed \(l\) and \(k\text{.}\) Now, we will count the number of strings for which the <em class="emphasis">sum</em> of the length and the weight is fixed. For example, let's count all the bit strings for which \(l+k = 11\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Find examples of these strings of different lengths. What is the longest string possible? What is the shortest?</p></li>
<li><p>How many strings are there of each of these lengths. Use this to count the total number of strings (with sum 11).</p></li>
<li><p>The other approach: Let \(n = l+k\) vary. How many strings have sum \(n = 1\text{?}\) How many have sum \(n = 2\text{?}\) And so on. Find and explain a recurrence relation for the sequence \((a_n)\) which gives the number of strings with sum \(n\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Describe what you have found above in terms of Pascal's Triangle. What pattern have you discovered?</p></li>
