<p>Let's try the pizza counting example like we did above. How many ways are there to pick \(k\) toppings from a list of \(n\) choices? On the one hand, the answer is simply \({n \choose k}\text{.}\) Alternatively, you could make a list of all the toppings you don't want. To end up with a pizza containing exactly \(k\) toppings, you need to pick \(n-k\) toppings to not put on the pizza. You have \({n \choose n-k}\) choices for the toppings you don't want. Both of these ways give you a pizza with \(k\) toppings, in fact all the ways to get a pizza with \(k\) toppings. Thus these two answers must be the same: \({n \choose k} = {n \choose n-k}\text{.}\)</p>
