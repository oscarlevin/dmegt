<p> Start by saying what the statement is that you want to prove: “Let \(P(n)\) be the statement…” To prove that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 0\text{,}\) you must prove two facts:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Base case: Prove that \(P(0)\) is true. You do this directly. This is often easy.</p></li>
<li><p>Inductive case: Prove that \(P(k) \imp P(k+1)\) for all \(k \ge 0\text{.}\) That is, prove that for any \(k \ge 0\) if \(P(k)\) is true, then \(P(k+1)\) is true as well. This is the proof of an if … then … statement, so you can assume \(P(k)\) is true (\(P(k)\) is called the <em class="emphasis">inductive hypothesis</em>).  You must then explain why \(P(k+1)\) is also true, given that assumption.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming you are successful on both parts above, you can conclude, “Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 0\text{.}\)”</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_seq-induction.html#UaZ">in-context</a></span>
