<p>You can think of “if and only if” statements as having two parts: an implication and its converse. We might say one is the “if” part, and the other is the “only if” part. We also sometimes say that “if and only if” statements have two directions: a forward direction \((P \imp Q)\) and a backwards direction (\(P \leftarrow Q\text{,}\) which is really just sloppy notation for \(Q \imp P\)).</p>
