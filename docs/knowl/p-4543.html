<p>We have seen that it is often easier to find recursive definitions than closed formulas. Lucky for us, there are a few techniques for converting recursive definitions to closed formulas. Doing so is called <dfn class="terminology">solving a recurrence relation</dfn>. Recall that the recurrence relation is a recursive definition without the initial conditions. For example, the recurrence relation for the Fibonacci sequence  is \(F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}\text{.}\) (This, together with the initial conditions \(F_0 = 0\) and \(F_1 = 1\) give the entire recursive <em class="emphasis">definition</em> for the sequence.)</p>
