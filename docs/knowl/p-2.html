<p>This book would not exist if not for “Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics” by Richard Grassl and Tabitha Mingus. It is the book I learned discrete math out of, and taught out of the semester before I began writing this text. I wanted to maintain the inquiry based feel of their book but update, expand and rearrange some of the material. Some of the best exposition and exercises here were graciously donated from this source.</p>
